OVERVIEW\r\n\r\nThe \"eFuzyon Project\" was created by \"eFuzyon Technology\" to help PHP developers\r\nwith boring tasks like cleaning up strings, generating URI strings, and others.\r\n\r\nOur main focus is to increase your productivity while maintaining or creating a\r\ncertain degree of organization on your code.\r\n\r\nAs this project evolves, we'll try to increase the range of classes and methods\r\nto help a number even bigger of developers.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any classes or methods to be included on the project.\r\nYou can track our development at https://github.com/eFuzyon/eFuzyon\r\n\r\n###2. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n- We recommend you use a PHP version equal or superior to 5.3.\r\n\r\nThis project might work with versions lower than 5.3. We do not guarantee it.\r\n\r\n###3. INSTALLATION\r\n\r\n- Easy to implement\r\n\r\nAll you need to do is to include the \"efuzyon.init.php\" file to your code and\r\ncheck the \"demo\" folder for usage examples.\r\n\r\n###4. USAGE EXAMPLE\r\n\r\n    <?php\r\n        // Include the eFuzyon bootstrap\r\n        include \"../../lib/efuzyon.init.php\";\r\n\r\n        // Add the raw value to a variable\r\n        $value = \"<strong>H'i! Thîs ís ä tëst.</strong>\";\r\n\r\n        // Generate URI from the raw value\r\n        $newValue = eFuzyon\\URI::Generate($value, array(\r\n            \"clean\" => true, // Default: false\r\n            \"separator\" => \"-\" // Default: \"-\"\r\n        ));\r\n\r\n        // Output the URI\r\n        echo $newValue; // The output will be: \"hi-this-is-a-teste\"\r\n    ?>\r\n\r\n###5. TROUBLESHOOTING\r\n\r\nThis version of the project is still in beta phase and as such, may contain a \r\nnumber of bugs and be a little bit rough around the edges.\r\n\r\nLet us know if you have any classes or methods to be included on the project.\r\nYou can track our development at https://github.com/eFuzyon/eFuzyon\r\n\r\n###6.
